# JavaScript Calculator
Live --->  https://perfekty.github.io/JavaScript---Calculator/

Hello,
there is my small project of JavaScript calculator.

Features:

✩ `You can perfrom basic opertations like *, /, -, +.`

✩ `Dividing by zero doesn't work, try if you don't believe me :)`

✩ `Dot (comma) represents fractions, so it means that number zero don't need to be displayed.`

If you'll like it leave a star for me.
Thanks and enjoy!
