Hello,

there is my small project of JavaScript calculator.

You can perfrom basic opertations like *, /, -, +.

Dividing by zero doesn't work, try if you don't believe me :)

Dot (comma) represents fractions, so it means that number zero don't need to be displayed.

If you'll like it leave a star for me.

Thanks and enjoy!
